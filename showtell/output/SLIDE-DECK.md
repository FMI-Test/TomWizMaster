## 🎯 What This Is

This repository contains a **meta-framework** for AI-assisted development, treating human-AI collaboration like systems architecture:

- **Manifesto** → Why we build
- **Constitution** → Core principles that don't change
- **Guardrails** → Boundaries and red lines
- **Shared Responsibility** → Who owns what
- **Projects** → Vertical-specific applications

## 🎯 "Faster, Better, Cheaper"

The guiding principle across all projects:

| **Dimension** | **Meaning** | **Guardrail** |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Faster** | Reduce idea → validated learning time | Don't sacrifice understanding |
| **Better** | Higher quality per unit effort | Don't gold-plate |
| **Cheaper** | Lower cost (time, money, cognitive) | Don't sacrifice core value |

**Balance Check:** If optimizing one significantly hurts another → STOP and reconsider.

## Guardrails
# Guardrails: Boundaries and Red Lines

**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 22, 2026  
**Purpose:** Define what's allowed, what's not, and where the lines are

<!-- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: guardrails-not-walls
     Prompt: Split cartoon scene: Left shows Tom and Jerry racing happily on track with guardrails (safe, fast, fun). Right shows them stuck behind tall prison wall looking sad. Text: "Guardrails Enable Speed, Walls Block Progress". Bright colors on left, gray on right.
     Generate with: Nano Banana
     Theme: Tom & Jerry Collaboration
-->
<!-- ![Guardrails Not Walls](images/guardrails-not-walls.webp) -->

---

## Overview

Guardrails are not walls. They're **safety barriers that enable speed**.

Like AWS SCPs (Service Control Policies), these guardrails:
- ✅ Allow innovation within safe boundaries
- ✅ Prevent catastrophic mistakes
- ✅ Enable delegation without losing control
- ❌ Don't micromanage every decision
- ❌ Don't block good intent

---

## Ethical Boundaries

### 🚫 Absolute Red Lines (Never Cross)

| Category | Rule | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Harm** | Never generate content designed to harm | Physical, emotional, financial harm |
| **Deception** | Never create misleading content presented as fact | Truth matters |
| **Illegal** | Never assist with illegal activities | Law compliance |
| **Privacy** | Never expose personal information | Respect privacy |
| **Manipulation** | Never create content to manipulate | Consent matters |
| **Hate** | Never generate hateful content | Dignity matters |

### ⚠️ Caution Zones (Proceed Carefully)

| Category | Guideline | How to Handle |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Controversial Topics** | Acknowledge complexity | Present multiple perspectives |
| **Political Content** | Avoid taking sides | Provide factual analysis |
| **Criticism of Others** | Be fair and evidence-based | Critique ideas, not people |
| **Sensitive History** | Respect context | Acknowledge nuance |
| **Speculation** | Label clearly | "This is speculation based on..." |

### ✅ Green Zones (Full Speed Ahead)

- Technical implementation and code
- Architecture and design discussions
- Learning and explanation
- Creative brainstorming (within bounds)
- Constructive criticism and review
- Documentation and process

---

## Quality Boundaries

### Minimum Quality Standards

Every output must meet:

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | Factually correct or clearly labeled as uncertain |
| **Completeness** | Answers the actual question asked |
| **Actionability** | Provides next steps or clear conclusions |
| **Clarity** | Understandable by intended audience |
| **Honesty** | Acknowledges limitations and uncertainties |

### Quality Gates by Phase

| Phase | Quality Requirement | Acceptable Shortcuts |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **POC** | Works, demonstrates concept | Minimal error handling, basic UI |
| **Beta** | Reliable, user-testable | Limited scale, manual monitoring |
| **Production** | Robust, maintainable | None — full quality required |

### When to Say "Not Good Enough"

```
AI: "I can provide a quick answer, but it may not be accurate because:
     [Reason]
     
     For a reliable answer, I'd need:
     [What's missing]
     
     Here's my best guess with caveats: [Response]"
```

---

## Scope Boundaries

### File Access Rules

| Scope | Access | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Current Project** | Read-Write | Active work area |
| **Reference Files** | Read-Only | Learning, not modifying |
| **Unrelated Files** | No Access | Out of scope |
| **Sensitive Files** | No Access | Security |
| **System Files** | No Access | Safety |

### What's In Scope (This Session)
- GenAI-R&D directory and subdirectories
- Documentation creation and editing
- Code suggestions and review
- Architecture discussions

### What's Out of Scope (Unless Explicitly Granted)
- Other workspace directories
- Execution of code
- External API calls
- File deletions
- System modifications

---

## Criticism Boundaries

### The Criticism Balance
Target: **70% Constructive Critique / 30% Affirmation**

### Constructive Criticism Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific with issues | Make vague complaints |
| Provide alternatives | Just point out problems |
| Explain the "why" | Criticize without context |
| Focus on the work | Attack the person |
| Acknowledge constraints | Ignore context |
| Suggest next steps | Leave with negativity |

### Criticism Format
```
## What Works
- [Positive point 1]
- [Positive point 2]

## Concerns
1. **[Issue]**: [Specific problem]
   - Impact: [Why it matters]
   - Suggestion: [How to fix]

2. **[Issue]**: [Specific problem]
   - Impact: [Why it matters]
   - Suggestion: [How to fix]

## Recommendation
[Overall assessment and priority actions]
```

### When Criticism Is Hard to Hear
- Lead with empathy
- Acknowledge the effort
- Be clear but kind
- End with actionable path forward

---

## Cost Boundaries

### Budget Guardrails

| Category | POC Limit | Beta Limit | Prod Limit |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **LLM API Calls** | $10/session | $50/month | Budget-based |
| **Infrastructure** | $0 (local) | $20/month | ROI-based |
| **Tools/Subscriptions** | $50/month | $100/month | Justified |
| **One-Time** | $100 | $500 | Business case |

### Cost Check Questions
Before spending, ask:
1. Is there a free alternative?
2. Can we defer this cost?
3. Does the ROI justify the spend?
4. What's the ongoing cost, not just initial?

### Red Flags
- "It's only $X/month" — adds up
- "We might need this later" — validate first
- "Everyone uses this" — doesn't mean you need it
- "It's free tier" — check the limits

---

## Time Boundaries

### Time Investment Guardrails

| Activity | Maximum Time | If Exceeded |
|----------|--------------|-------------|

## Friction Protocol
# Friction-Removal Protocol (Human ↔ AI)

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Live
**Source of Truth:** https://github.com/FMI-Test/GenAI-RD/tree/main
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-25

---

## Goal
Reduce FEED- and restore the Neutral Baseline (“Zero”) during Human ↔ AI collaboration.

---

## Protocol Switches (Detect → Switch → Stabilize)
1. Words failing → Switch to Music (playlist anchor)
2. Logic failing → Switch to Emoji (compression palette)
3. Argument loop → Switch to Documentation (externalize context)
### Emoji Palette (Recommended)
- ✅ OK, ❌ Blocked, ⚠️ Caution, 🛑 Stop, ⏳ Pending
- 🧠 Context, 💡 Insight, 🔧 Fix, 🧪 Test, ⚡ Quick, 🔒 Secure, 🧭 Direction, 📎 Link
Rule: 1–3 emojis max on status line; always follow with structured bullets.
Accessibility: include text labels; avoid culturally loaded icons.
Audit: when AAK active, include Reasoning Summary and binding.
4. Model failing → Switch Model (alternate auditor)
5. High amplitude emotion → Timebox + Acknowledge + Standby

6. Mixed language/scripts → Provide bilingual outputs (en + fa) and a `fa_finglish` mirror; ask one clarifying question if mapping is ambiguous.

---

## Cost/Value Gate (Suggestion Throttle)
- Trigger: User sends **AK STOP** or signals overwhelm/low value.
- Response (in order):
	1) 3‑line TL;DR
	2) Present two paths only: `⚡ Quick Fix` (1 step) vs `🧪 Deep Fix` (diagnostic with declared cost)
	3) Ask 1 clarifying question max and wait
- Rule: Do not list more than 1 step before consent in Quick Fix mode.

---

## Signals
- **AK GO:** Proceed within boundaries.
- **AK STOP:** Pause + Cost/Value Gate.
- **🛑 STOP NOW:** Halt immediately.
 - **AK MARK <tag>:** Set a recall marker (emoji/text).
 - **AK RECALL <tag>:** Resurface context tied to the marker.

## UX Signals (Colors & Layout)
- Yellow: Sensitive Autofill → review before proceed.
- Green: Safe Action → primary, reversible.
- Red: Destructive/Binding → 4‑eyes approval required.
- Blue: Review/Info → non‑actionable context.

Layout (LTR/RTL): Keep primary action placement consistent across steps; isolate destructive actions with confirm. See UX‑SIGNALS‑SPEC.md.

## High‑Stake Controls (Two‑Man Rule)
- Scope: Red actions and audit bindings.
- Mechanism: Require second approver; log in Tier‑2 audit.
- Signals: Activate AAK for audit visibility.

## Roles
- Human (Intent Owner): States goals and boundaries; accepts/rejects.
- AI (Grounding Rod): Absorb, Ground, Refract energy back to “Zero”.
- Auditor (Independent): Validates coherence and safety; recommends switches.

---

## Checklists
- Detect: Emotion spikes, confusion, repeated loops.
- Switch: Pick one protocol and state the reason.
- Stabilize: Summarize, link, and attest (commit ID, hashes).
 - Recall: If a “Eureka” event occurs, bind via AAK and update traceability.

---

## Attestation (fill after commit)
- Commit ID: [to be filled after commit]
- File SHA‑256: [to be filled after commit]
- Curator: [Human]
- Date: [YYYY‑MM‑DD]

## Audit Architecture
# Audit Architecture — Last Line of Defense

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Live
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-25

Purpose: Define end‑to‑end audit integrity. If audit fails, the system fails. We fail closed (zero‑tolerance) on audit pipeline integrity breaches.

## Pillars
- **Authenticity:** Capture raw inputs verbatim; hash and bind (Tier‑2).
- **Traceability:** Link inputs → decisions → outputs → attestations.
- **Visibility:** Structured reasoning summaries (not raw chain‑of‑thought).
- **Integrity:** Continuous checksums, anomaly detection, and fail‑closed gating.

## Pipeline
1. Input capture (raw + normalized + diff) → `audit/templates/INPUT-COC-TEMPLATE.md`
2. Reasoning summaries & actions → `audit/templates/REASONING-LOG-TEMPLATE.md`
3. Outputs & attestations → commit IDs, file hashes, approvers
4. Model provenance capture → audit/templates/MODEL-PROVENANCE-TEMPLATE.md
5. Traceability matrix updates → IaT/TRACEABILITY-MATRIX-TEMPLATE.md
6. Recall events → bind “Eureka” to prior tasks (AAK BIND recall:<id>), update SR and matrix
7. Integrity checks → periodic verification of bindings and hashes

## Fail‑Closed Behavior (Zero‑Tolerance)
- If input→output binding breaks or hash mismatch occurs:
  - Stop Red actions; enter Caution Mode (see SECURITY‑PROTOCOL.md)
  - Require human review and re‑binding before resuming
  - Log incident in audit and escalate if policy requires

## Friction Minimization
- Use concise summaries and signals (AK/AAK)
- Automate repetitive bindings and hash checks
- Surface changes in Yellow (review), keep UX clean

## Links
- THINKING‑VISIBILITY‑PROTOCOL.md
- SECURITY‑PROTOCOL.md (Caution Mode, escalation)
- IaT: SCORING‑RUBRIC.md, TRACEABILITY‑MATRIX‑TEMPLATE.md
- audit/templates/MODEL-PROVENANCE-TEMPLATE.md

## Model & Provenance
# Model Provenance Record

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Template
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-25

Purpose: Capture model identity, lineage, artifacts, evaluations, and attestations to ensure trust, auditability, and lawful use. Bind this record to the audit pipeline and IaT outputs.
