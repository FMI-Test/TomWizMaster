# Executive Summary — GenAI R&D — Show & Tell

## Source: README.md
# GenAI Research & Development
## 🎯 What This Is
- **Manifesto** → Why we build
- **Constitution** → Core principles that don't change
- **Guardrails** → Boundaries and red lines
- **Shared Responsibility** → Who owns what
- **Projects** → Vertical-specific applications
## 📚 Documentation Structure
## 🚀 Quick Start
### For AI Agents
### For Humans
### For Collaborators
- New: IaT (Infrastructure‑as‑Text) workflow — see IaT/README.md for intake, checklist, SR, reference architecture, decision options, and change analysis.
- See [ARCHITECTURE-HIERARCHY.md](ARCHITECTURE-HIERARCHY.md) for System → Platform → App navigation and X → Y substitutions with built‑in pro/con.
- Emoji Compression — see [EMOJI-COMPRESSION.md](EMOJI-COMPRESSION.md) for quick status language and accessibility guidance.
- Show & Tell — see [SHOW-AND-TELL.md](SHOW-AND-TELL.md) to generate slide decks and executive summaries from docs.
## 🧠 Core Philosophy
### The AWS Parallel
### The Constitutional Parallel
## 📊 Projects Overview

## Source: COMPLIANCE.md
# Compliance as Code: A Constitutional Approach
## 1. Core Compliance Philosophy
- **`CONSTITUTION.md`**: The immutable rules of our system.
- **`GUARDRAILS.md`**: The Service Control Policies (SCPs) that define our boundaries.
- **`SHARED-RESPONSIBILITY.md`**: The clear delineation of Human vs. AI accountability.
- **`DESIGN.md`**: The audit trail (like CloudTrail) showing how the system was built.
- **Git History**: The immutable ledger of all changes, providing a chain of custody.
### Security & Escalation

## 2. How Compliance is Measured
## 3. Extending Compliance with "One-Shot" Audits
### The 5-Line Instruction to Initiate a One-Shot Compliance Audit:
## 4. Dependencies & Adherence to Guidelines
- **Dependencies**: This compliance model has no external runtime dependencies. Its dependencies are the internal, version-controlled documents of this repository (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `GUARDRAILS.md`, etc.).
- **Adherence**: This document adheres to the repository guidelines by:
- **Inheriting Principles**: It is built upon the existing constitutional framework.
- **Providing Transparency**: It documents the "how" and "why" of our compliance approach.

# Friction-Removal Protocol (Human ↔ AI)
## Goal
## Protocol Switches (Detect → Switch → Stabilize)
### Emoji Palette (Recommended)
- ✅ OK, ❌ Blocked, ⚠️ Caution, 🛑 Stop, ⏳ Pending
- 🧠 Context, 💡 Insight, 🔧 Fix, 🧪 Test, ⚡ Quick, 🔒 Secure, 🧭 Direction, 📎 Link
## Cost/Value Gate (Suggestion Throttle)
- Trigger: User sends **AK STOP** or signals overwhelm/low value.
- Response (in order):
- Rule: Do not list more than 1 step before consent in Quick Fix mode.
## Signals
- **AK GO:** Proceed within boundaries.
- **AK STOP:** Pause + Cost/Value Gate.
- **🛑 STOP NOW:** Halt immediately.
- **AK MARK <tag>:** Set a recall marker (emoji/text).
- **AK RECALL <tag>:** Resurface context tied to the marker.
## UX Signals (Colors & Layout)
- Yellow: Sensitive Autofill → review before proceed.
- Green: Safe Action → primary, reversible.
- Red: Destructive/Binding → 4‑eyes approval required.

## Source: AUDIT-ARCHITECTURE.md
# Audit Architecture — Last Line of Defense
## Pillars
- **Authenticity:** Capture raw inputs verbatim; hash and bind (Tier‑2).
- **Traceability:** Link inputs → decisions → outputs → attestations.
- **Visibility:** Structured reasoning summaries (not raw chain‑of‑thought).
- **Integrity:** Continuous checksums, anomaly detection, and fail‑closed gating.
## Pipeline
## Fail‑Closed Behavior (Zero‑Tolerance)
- If input→output binding breaks or hash mismatch occurs:
- Stop Red actions; enter Caution Mode (see SECURITY‑PROTOCOL.md)
- Require human review and re‑binding before resuming
- Log incident in audit and escalate if policy requires
## Friction Minimization
- Use concise summaries and signals (AK/AAK)
- Automate repetitive bindings and hash checks
- Surface changes in Yellow (review), keep UX clean
