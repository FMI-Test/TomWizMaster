# iStripper Scene Data Directory

# iStripper uses .scn files to store scene data. These files are typically located in the data/scenes directory of the iStripper installation.
/Users/bamdad/iStripper/data/scenes/../*.scn
... *.scn

# Corrupted Scene Files, Backup, and Recovery
# If you encounter corrupted scene files, iStripper may create backup copies with a .bak extension. You can try renaming these .bak files back to .scn to recover your scenes.
/Users/bamdad/iStripper/data/scenes/../*.bak
... *.bak   

# Custom Scene Locations    
# If you have customized the location of your scene files, ensure to check those directories as well.
/Users/bamdad/iStripper/custom_scenes/../*.scn
... *.scn

# iStripper User Data Directory & Custom Scenes
# If you have a user data directory set up for iStripper, your custom scenes might be stored there as well.
/Users/bamdad/iStripper/user_data/scenes/../*.scn
... *.scn   
```

## Customization & Recovery
iStripper allows users to create and customize their own scenes. If you have created custom scenes, ensure to back them up regularly to avoid data loss. In case of corruption, check for any backup files (.bak) that iStripper may have generated.
