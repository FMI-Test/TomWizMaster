# Scoring Rubric — Cost / Time / Value / Risk

Use this rubric to normalize evaluations for X → Y substitutions and option choices (A/B/C).

## Scales (1–5)
- **Cost** (Total cost of ownership)
  - 1: Minimal — negligible spend/ops
  - 2: Low — small incremental cost
  - 3: Medium — noticeable opex/capex
  - 4: High — significant budget impact
  - 5: Very High — major investment
- **Time** (Lead time / complexity)
  - 1: Immediate — hours/days
  - 2: Short — < 2 weeks
  - 3: Moderate — 2–6 weeks
  - 4: Long — 6–12 weeks
  - 5: Very Long — > 12 weeks
- **Value** (Outcome alignment)
  - 1: Minimal — nice‑to‑have only
  - 2: Some — incremental improvement
  - 3: Solid — meets key goals
  - 4: High — accelerates goals broadly
  - 5: Very High — strategic leverage
- **Risk** (Security/Compliance/Operational)
  - 1: Minimal — well‑understood, safe
  - 2: Low — manageable, known mitigations
  - 3: Medium — notable exposure, mitigations required
  - 4: High — significant exposure, strong controls required
  - 5: Very High — critical exposure, avoid unless mandated

## Composite Score
- Suggested: `Benefit Index = Value – (Cost + Time + Risk)/3`
- Choose Option A/B/C by maximizing Benefit Index while respecting guardrails.

## Notes
- Tie decisions to SR constraints and guardrails.
- Document assumptions; bind evaluation to Tier‑2 audit when AAK is active.
