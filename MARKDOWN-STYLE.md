# Markdown Style Guide — Consistency & Tone

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Live
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-25

## Headings
- Use `#`–`###` for structure; keep titles short (1–3 words).
- Start sections with a concise purpose sentence when helpful.

## Bullets
- Use `-` with a space for bullets; keep lines concise.
- Bold key terms (`**Keyword:**`) followed by a short description.
- Avoid deep nesting; prefer short, grouped lists.

## Links
- Use relative paths and keep display text clear.
- Cross-link core docs where relevant (README, DESIGN, COMPLIANCE, protocols).

## Tone
- Concise, direct, friendly; actionable guidance.
- Prefer present tense and active voice.
- Summaries over exposition; Reasoning Summary blocks when AAK active.

## Formatting
- Word wrap on; LF line endings; trim trailing whitespace (repo defaults).
- Allow inline HTML in special cases (placeholders, diagrams) sparingly.

## References
- Workspace: `.vscode/settings.json`, `.editorconfig`
- Lint: `.markdownlint.json`
