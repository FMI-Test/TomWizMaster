### Gathering » March
Marching to gather resources is a fundamental aspect of Top War. Efficient gathering strategies can significantly boost your resource income, allowing for faster base development and troop training.

**Ideal Gathering March:**
An ideal gathering march has less than 1 day (24h) gathering speed on RSS6 resources, allowing full gathering of RSS6 resources per day to maximize crafting Arsenal Components.

1. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 1d or less
2. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 1d 1h - 6h
3. ⭐⭐⭐ 1d 6h - 12h
4. ⭐⭐ 1d 12h - 18h
5. ⭐ 1d 18h or more

**War Hall » Lineup » Gather Table**
| Performance | Speed | Full Size | March |
|---|---|---|---|
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 1d 6h | 72 | Kate Curry, Black Widow, Ishi Tarou |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | 1d 12h | 72 | Hammer, Rambo, Wade |
| ⭐⭐ | 1d 14h | 63 | Ganso, Alex, O’Neill |
| ⭐ | 2d 2h | 72 | Ricardo, Simon, Tywin |
| ⭐⭐ | 1d 16h | 63 | Dr. Gero, Amalia, Friedman Hetrz |
| ⭐ | 1d 23h | 63 | Stoick, Reichstein, Bob |
| ⭐⭐ | 1d 16h | 72 | Bob, Smion, Belleveu |

### Gathering » RSS6
RSS6 refers to level 6 `Farmland`, or `Oil Field` resource tiles, which give special colored stones used to craft components for equipment.

**Colored Stones Rarity:**
1. **Green**: Common rarity.
2. **Blue**: Uncommon rarity.
3. **Purple**: Rare rarity.
4. **Gold (or orange)**: Super Rare rarity.

**How to Use RSS6 Stones:**
1. Gather from RSS6 Tiles to obtain the colored stones.
2. Use the stones to craft components for different equipment types.
3. As you acquire more stones, you can craft higher-rarity equipment.

**Importance of Gathering RSS6 Stones:**
* **`Craft Center` upgrades**: 4 different colored stones craft a Lv. 3 component.
* **A major source of power**: High-level equipment improves your combat power.
* **Alliance benefit**: RSS6 spawns in the Ruins Campaign.

### Gathering » RSS6 & Colored Stones
In gathering marches, sending fewer units to RSS6 does reduce colored stone drops. Unit count affects carrying capacity, and stone yield.

**Key Points:**
* The total amount of colored stones is fixed.
* Gathering speed and capacity are keys for efficiency.
* More units increase your carrying capacity.
* The key to maximizing stones is load capacity.
* Larger the gathering load, the more stones you get.

**RSS6 Gathering Strategy:**
To maximize your stone yield from RSS6, consider the following strategies:
* Send full units to increase carrying capacity.
* Optimize speed using hero gathering speed skills.
* Maximize capacity using hero load capcity skills.
* Utilize heroes with gathering bonuses.

**Rapid Gathering vs. Full Capacity:**
As shown in the top four rapid gathering reports, the colored stone average yield is `2.5` stones, but in the three bottom full capacity gathering reports the colored stone average yield is `5` stones.

### Hero Bond
Hero Bonds are special relationships between certain heroes that provide additional bonuses when those heroes are in your roster, regardless of whether those heroes are used together in a march.

### Hero » List
1. `R`: Rare
2. `SR`: Super Rare
3. `SSR`: Super Super Rare (also called Legendary)

### Hero » March Combat Power
To underestand **Quede Combat Power** notice when you hit **World Boss** 5 times each round, maultiple times in day the damage per hit changes each time randomly even when all other factors are constant. This is due to complex calculation of **Quede Combat Power** which depends on many factors including hero march size, decoration march size, hero bond for march size, unit types of oponnets, buffs and other combat related upgrades.

**Top War** adding insult to injury when player add more buff, more power and after weeeks of grinding and many relvant upgrades when everything seems better, attacking the `WB` not only won‘t improve but the damage per hit decrases! This is due to complex calculation of **Quede Combat Power** which depends on many factors with a twist of so called randomness.

 Some may argue this randomness add more exictment to the game but the question is why is always in the negative direction? some may counter argue that beacuse of randomness you hit harder than you could and becaue of randomness that best attack was a jackpot hit. But in reality is in-game purchace feature of freemium and is more like business intentional reason than what is argued based on complex formula with randomness!
