## Middle East (selected)

### United Arab Emirates (UAE)
- Themes: UAE PDPL; purpose limitation; consent; cross-border transfer governance; accountability.
- Actions: document purposes; minimize data; disclosures for AI involvement; assess cross-border transfers; DPIA where risk is non-trivial.

### Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)
- Themes: PDPL; potential localization/transfer conditions; controller obligations; transparency.
- Actions: maintain processing records; enable access/erasure; evaluate localization/transfer gateways; log decisions affecting individuals.

### Qatar
- Themes: PDPL; transfer restrictions; security and accuracy duties.
- Actions: classify data; apply transfer assessments; track provenance; apply source deference for factual claims.

### Bahrain
- Themes: PDPL (registration/notification elements); purpose limitation; data subject rights.
- Actions: catalog datasets; implement DSAR workflows; minimize retention; disclose AI assistance where outputs affect users.

### Israel
- Themes: privacy law and regulator guidance; fairness/accuracy principles; database management obligations.
- Actions: maintain data inventories; risk reviews for automated decision contexts; document model limitations in user-facing surfaces.

### Egypt / Jordan (evolving frameworks)
- Themes: emerging data protection regimes; cross-border transfer caution; rights enablement.
- Actions: conservative defaults: consent recording, purpose binding, transfer due diligence, and human review for high-stakes cases.

## US Allies (selected)

### Canada
- Themes: PIPEDA principles (accountability, consent, limiting use, accuracy); proposed AI-specific legislation.
- Actions: enable challenge/correction; explainability appropriate to context; log automated decision support.

### Australia
- Themes: Privacy Act obligations; OAIC guidance; AI ethics principles (safety, transparency, accountability).
- Actions: impact assessments for consequential uses; user disclosures; robust incident logging and remediation loops.

## Cross-Region Common Denominators
- Transparency: disclose AI involvement and known limitations for material decisions.
- Evidence: keep logs, data lineage, and rationale traces proportionate to risk.
- Human-in-the-loop: require review/appeal for high-stakes decisions.
- Risk management: classify use cases early; perform lightweight DPIAs where appropriate; monitor post-release and iterate.
