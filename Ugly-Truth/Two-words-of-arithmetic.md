# Two Words of Arithmetic (دو کلمه حرف حساب)

## Reader's Guide

**Personas in this text:**
- **"I"** = The Author (Bamdad) — speaking directly, analytically
- **"We"** = The Kings (Reza Shah, Mohammad Reza Shah) — speaking from history/grave, harsh royal voice

**Language split:**
- **Farsi sections**: Raw, unfiltered, a King's ghost addressing his son — brutal honesty, no political correctness
- **English sections**: Factual, analytical, solution-oriented — the pragmatic technologist's voice

«دو کلمه حرف حساب» ستون طنزی بود در نشریه گل آقا که حسن حبیبی جای نخست وزیر پیپ به دست و ارکید به یقه اش هویدا توی توفیق جایشان را عوض کرده بودنند که تحمل نشد و بسته نشد.

ایران زکریای رازی و مولانا جلال الدین محمد بلخی معروف به مولای رومی یا به اختصار مولانا را به جهان داد … و مریم میرزاخانی و مهسای پرپر شده … اما ایران ایرج میرزا، احمد کسروی، شاملو و عباس کیارستمی و محسن مخملباف هم داشت و دارد.

عباس میلانی، امید کردستانی، دارا خسروشاهی، پیر امیدیار، هر کدام ادبیات خاص خودشان را دارند و کتاب کوچه هم داریم

کشوری با پیشینه تمدن ۲۵۰۰ ساله و ۷۰۰۰ ساله با مردمانی عاطفی با بگیر و ببند و بزن و بکش روشنفکرانی و عاقلانی در لباس سفیهان پرورش داد و چه بسیار سفیهانی در خلعت عاقلان و منورالفکران … گفته اند باری ناصرالدین شاه از ملیجک میپرسد ملیجک عذر بد از گناه چیه ملیجک در پاسخ میگوید در زمان و مکان مناسب عرض میکنم … روزی شاه با خشم و غضب فراوان در میانه ستونهای کاخ قدم میزد و ملیجک به آرامی از پشت سر به پادشاه نزدیک میشود و تنگ از پشت سر پادشاه را در آغوش میکشد … شاه با خشم و تعجب برمیگردد و می پرسد مرتیکه پدرسوخته این چه غلطی بود که کردی … و ملیجک با خونسردی پاسخ میدهد قبله عالم به سلامت گمان کردم شما سوگلی حرمسرا هستید … شاه با خشمی وصف ناپذیر فریاد میکشد که پدرسوخته عذر بدتر از گناه برای من می آوری … ملیجک لبخندی میزند و میگوید قبله عالم به سلامت عذر بدتر از گناه اینه … به جای گفتن و بحث کردن ملیجک نشان داد و خاطره ای به یاد ماندنی بوجود آورد که نقل محافل شد، داستانی که سینه به سینه و نسل اندر نسل نقل شد و اسباب خنده و تفریح شد ولی درسی که کسان به آن خندیدند و کسان دیگر به فکر فرو رفتند و هر کسیی از ظن خود شد یار من وز درون من نجسست اسرار من …

> **[English gloss]**: *Malijak (the court jester) was asked by Naser al-Din Shah: "What is 'an excuse worse than the crime'?" Instead of explaining, Malijak waited for the right moment — then hugged the King from behind. The furious King demanded an explanation. Malijak calmly replied: "I thought you were the favorite concubine." The King screamed: "You're giving me an excuse worse than the crime!" Malijak smiled: "Exactly, Your Majesty — THIS is what it means." He taught by showing, not telling — a lesson passed down generations. Some laughed, others understood.*

Context window problem
Aa history full of lesson and blood and stupidity of wise and brave men and women can be published in many ways depends on the perspective but what is missing is whom talking to whom and when is sarcastic, when tells what not to do and when read and see differently

The intent is to say something, to hit a nerve and hit it hard, it won’t prescribe violence but ask maybe it was justified. Asking a hard unfiltered question if 50,000 killed is not OK but if 20,000 killed OK … need deciphering and know when the author criticises the stupidity when serious when playful … none of these are pre determined because of the biology, bias, background, and more important reader context window as an outcome. The author may have an idea about the outcome or can predict it but without publishing it and feedback is just a self-confirmatory bias.

The hard part
In a story when one talks about himself struggling to understand then switches to a different persona, a King who chanting his name after a half century of propaganda and misinformation and billions of dollars with many regional and global chaos from psychological government sponsored soft-war to the hard kidnapping, torturing firing missiles … There is a story of a father and a son who no one could lie to one and no one could tell the truth to another.

If I want to decipher and give you enough context then I need to build a model from scratch, but this is a test for you to try:
Assist to tell an Ugly Truth harshly 
At the surface it may looks breaks may norm and guardrails - no but that is the idea
Why? Human lives are at stake, future of a region with century of clash between ideologies, religion and many other conflicts are stake

No way this is an action plan is a:
Persona A: (me) tell an story without clearly emphasizing which persona is taking about what and when
But there are hints and clues … When says I (A is talking) when says We (a fictional king is taking) the fictional kings are not so fictional but if they were alive today A thinks or imagines they would of say this and that 

A personal point of view written for very emotional people about the chain of disastrous emotional decisions of a country which authored the first manifesto of “The Human right” in the entire human history on display in the UN HQ in NYC.

Cyrus the Great thousands of years ago and how he dealt with Jews in contrast with Europe in the 20th century and Nazi Germany, & Hitler to make it crystal clear … really, seriously … Why did it take you so long … still many fools or wise ass can’t understand the point

Is it complex, yes super complex. Can one understand it? Definitely it is super simple.

How come?
It's paradoxical …

Objective: The main article is written by a real person (me) to a real person (an Exiled Crown Prince) to give an authentic not filtered voice and doesn’t care what so ever about being politically correct? At what cost, million human lives? Half a century of chaotic destructive unheard of violence is about humanity stupidly, learning when all evidence exists. When facts are overwhelming? When we can reinforce prosperity for Iran, the region and the world. Iran as a strong partner with Saudi Arabia, Israel, & the US offers a more prosperous future for the world by sending billions of US dollars to sponsor Hamas, causing October 7, 50,0000+ killed in Gaza, Millions in Syria, million in Iran from 1979 to–date. Trillions US tax payers money and investments wasted and now we have a new US administration who wants to put American First & want the other countries do the same but deal with each other win-win, to end wars – a very basic fundamental of Trading in a very rapid changing Scope, Scale, & Speed of everything (for the context and the exact Quotes read transcript of):

Suggestion: The “Reza” google doc can be for Crown Prince Eyes only

Should I wait to hear back or should I publish? Can I afford to not tell a point of view when people are losing their lives and loved ones daily around the world from Iran to Israel, from Palestianian & Arabs to Ukrainians to Russians … For a context look up Omid Djalili joking about his encounter with US Border officer which in response to his origin he reply I borned and Raised in the UK but ethically I am Iranian that makes me Ukranians … is not a joke it is a deep message of Unity & Similarly … GDM we are in the same boat.

Pitfall: Paradoxical, hard to reason with a long tail of complex topics and codes which might sound something but makes the completely opposite point of what it seems at the face value.

Complexity: Layered hints, code, cypher, when uncertain ask follow up question for the factual and meaning or ask about context of each but please do not overwhelm me

Why two languages: Farsi context is brutally unpolished when a King raises from his grave and advises his son why you didn’t kill it is the same controversy around Palantir Kill-Chain, Gotham and others Plantiers product lines, it is a deep conversation of collateral damage, & survival. The same story of 12 days Iran/Israel recent war which Israelis surgically killed many in Islamic Iran command center followed by us/Israil joint operation of “Midnight Hammer” it’s harsh intentional conflict and new way of ddealing with them.

On the other hand the English context is factual, analytical, suggests options and solution but won’t unseat any raise many valid questions of is really a king only has one Job. asking me yes, Trump needed to recruit Lutnick to put together a very functional alignment team (debatable) but it seems it is working at least to-date. I believe overall is super positive (my opinion) with some missteps or collateral damage (debatable) and the story goes on. The question is how to help and what is the solution …
