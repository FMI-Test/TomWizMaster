why: ssingle tassk env can eait -pre-rc pree-relae candidate refrence somewhere in repor to nvern happen again and each audit cheeck it to build--in by design ...

what:
- add a pre-rc pre-release candidate reference somewhere in the repository  to indicate that this is a pre-release candidate version of the software.
- ensure that the pre-rc reference is clearly visible and easily identifiable for users and developers.
- update documentation to explain the purpose of the pre-rc reference and how it should be used during the release process. 



- implement automated checks in the build and release process to verify the presence of the pre-rc reference before proceeding with any release activities.
