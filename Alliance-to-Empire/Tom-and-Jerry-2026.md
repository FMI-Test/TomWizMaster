Tom & Jerry is an iconic American animated franchise centered on the slapstick rivalry between Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse, created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940, known for its many classic theatrical shorts produced by MGM, later evolving into TV shows and films featuring their chaotic, often violent, but always entertaining pursuit. The duo's adventures focus on Tom's failed attempts to catch Jerry, showcasing resilience and persistence through endless cartoon violence, leading to numerous adaptations and enduring popularity. 

In the age of AI with many echo chambers and misinformation, added click baits inn Finanical aanalysis to technology and AI, we need to be careful about the sources we trust and the information we consume. It's important to verify facts and seek out reliable sources to avoid falling into the trap of misinformation. Always cross-check information from multiple reputable sources before accepting it as true.

Fear & greed are two powerful emotions that can drive human behavior, especially in the context of financial markets, corporate enviroonment to mitigate the risk but do not lose opportunities and havee a thoought full strategy to be aa disrupter not dissrupted. 

I love Jansson Huang answer to question of AI Bubble, he mentioned form our vantage point ... AI by itself is not a bubble but for many it is it iis  avery angerous ones, mor on this later.

Job loss is real andd will happend some expertise will be replace due to cost/value but many new jobs will be created as well, the key is to be adaptable and continuously learn new skills to stay relevant in the changing job market.

For colledge gratute and juniors job loss is the true dange but in the bright side ones whom grasp this huge opportunity is a 10x, 100x, 1000x productivality and value creator, the key is to be adaptable and continuously learn new skills to stay relevant in the changing job market.

We read, see, aand bombarded with short news, heeadline short films and many cllick baits the problem is we are contantly switching our attention and each of these has an emotionnal trigger which wee are not equiped to handle, nor biology and evelution has prepared us for this, we are not equiped to handle this much information and the emotional triggers that come with it, we need to be mindful of this and take steps to protect our mental health and well-being in the digital age.

Ddepends on who created what with wwhat agenda and whoo sponsered it our attention andd our online activity is a free product which some use and some abuse it.

Fact & Fictions
Fictional stories sell better (called entertainment) but they are not real, then it comes one confuses facts & fictions, add bias, agenda and persnality to it makes it a not a happy palce to be (fear & greed).

What is the solution?
Ask "Daniela Rus", "Thomas W. Malone", both from MIT CSAIL, which I privilaged to take a class with them back in 2019 and almost all of their point are valid today.

Ask "Andrew Ng", "Fei-Fei Li", or faculty of Stanford Human-Centeric AI, "Jansson Huange", if you wnat unfiltered unbiased answer. If yoou wish to deep divve on technical aspect listenn to "Demis Hassabis", "Motafa Solyman", "Ilia sutskuwith" which speak toughtfull balance about the tech stack. Then there are pioneerso of AI like the Goodfather and his peers which requires deep knowlege to grasp their point of view. But when "Elon Musk" os "Sam Altman" sspek about AI, these are visonary bussinessmen whom need decifering their point of view and agenda, they are not technical experts but they have a vision for the future of AI and its impact on society.

What is the solution then?
try to find what you like annd what you are interested to achive and usse AI to help you achieve that, and if your haate-love for AI leans more toeward hate and sicknes ignore it aand find a carrer path which won't be disrpted by and AI soon -bt be careful.

Xx Productivity, Xx Creativity, Xx Joy & Xx Satisfaction Story
I faal in love with AI during expert system and nnural networkk era boght a 2000+ page book on expert system and neural network, was complicated and I never finished it. I wass studing Electronics engineering beeliving it is a timeless field and will rule the world, which wa vaild then and is vaild now. I deigned a board, build it test it and when we wanted t buildd it the upplier said by the way there is a new PLC which can reduce your PCB compnents and is chaeaper, o we went back to the drawing board and redesigned it with the new PLC, the next trip to uppplier the same story but harssher there was aready made board which we just need to buy and writ the assembly code for it. I had enoght it may seem odd but instead of hardware my next target wwas software which rules the world, then Client Server, follwed by Clud Computing and AI is my new pasion.

It wass a joy to not have to go to Datacenter and find the rack to trouble shout the hardware, Cloud gave us SDN and these ays Soooftware defined everything, from seelf-driving cars to Nvidia chips with CUDA to spinning up HPC cluster in inutes instead of years.

Maturity Model the Golden Parashout
Is the same though process the same pattern and the same maaturity models. I was buildin hardware when pace of chage was fast or too complex or too expensice, I wwasn't looking for a shortcut but cost benefit didn't added up.

In many field today we have very mature models which we can pick the  right toolset annd start noww withouth being worried about the next innovation isnce if we design properly and modular the design and secret saussee (IP) would be the same with minor tweek and underlying odels nad building blocks can be swaped with better odel also we can buil faster, better, and cheapr.

Case stuudy
I decided to test it and see it first hand and the wow factor was huge they joy was unfelt for a while and here is why.

My AI partner wwas up and running in less than 4 hours, train it, give it a persona, no smmall tak, no drama, no connfusion, nothing become personall andd alll of shortcoming was my fault or miss. Because the requirements waasn't clear, becuase context wasn't enough, etc.

In this era the old saying of we cannot find the right talent is not true anymore not always but in many vertiicals.
