# Alliance to Empire Platform - Session Summary

**Date:** January 18, 2026  
**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### Documents Created/Updated
1. ✅ **PRINCIPLES.md** - Updated with subscription cost model
2. ✅ **alliance-to-empire-platform-v1.0-cr-REFINED.md** - Ultra-lean POC plan ready to execute
3. ✅ **TODO.md** - Complete roadmap from setup to growth
4. ✅ **GETTING-STARTED.md** - 30-minute quick start guide
5. ✅ **SUMMARY.md** - This file

### Key Decisions

**Cost Model with Your Subscriptions:**
- GitHub Copilot Pro: $10/month ✅ (you have this)
- Claude Code Pro/Max: $20-40/month (to subscribe)
- **Monthly Fixed: $30-50**
- **Per POC Session: $2-10 marginal cost**

**Approach:**
- Ultra-lean 2-4 hour POC
- Local Python script (no cloud infrastructure)
- AI pair programming (Claude Code + GitHub Copilot)
- Progressive enhancement: Local → Beta → Deploy (only if validated)

**Security:**
- Option A: New laptop for isolation ($800-1500)
- Option B: Secure guardrails on current MacBook Pro (free)
- You'll decide based on budget/risk tolerance

## 🎯 Philosophy Reminder

**From PRINCIPLES.md:**
- Start with ZERO infrastructure
- Validate before investing
- $10 spent > $1000 planned
- Working POC > perfect plan
- Ship > Perfect
- Faster, better, cheaper - always ask

**AI as Critical Peer:**
- Challenge assumptions
- Suggest alternatives  
- Ask "What could go wrong?"
- Review code critically
- Be helpful, not just agreeable

---

## 📞 When You Need Help

### Good Questions to Ask AI
- "What could go wrong with this approach?"
- "What are 3 alternatives to this design?"
- "Review this code - what would you improve?"
- "Explain this concept like I'm new to it"
- "What am I missing?"

### Bad Questions (Don't Ask)
- "Just build it for me" (learn, don't copy-paste)
- "Is this good?" (too vague)
- "Fix it" (understand the fix)
