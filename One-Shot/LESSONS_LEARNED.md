# Lessons Learned (One-Shot R&D)

## Key Takeaways
- Accuracy and context interpretation are critical; ambiguity should trigger follow-up or clarification.
- Documentation must be consistent, traceable, and reflect both explicit and implicit user intent.
- The process is iterative: read, reflect, recalibrate, and adapt as new context emerges.
- Self-image and communication style (IMAO vs IMHO) influence collaboration and understanding.
- Guardrails and limitations must be acknowledged and analyzed for transparency.
- Multi-shot, RAG, and post-training evaluation require both structured outputs and adaptive reasoning.

## Appendix/References
- See SESSION_SUMMARY.md, LIMITATIONS_AND_GUARDRAILS.md, images_TREE.md, and TODO.md for supporting details.

## Model Error & User Lesson
- **User Error**: Trusted past performance; did not verify model selection (GPT-4.1 vs Claude Opus 4.5).
- **Tooling Error**: VS Code auto-routed to GPT-4.1 due to budget; user expected Claude Opus 4.5.
- **Lesson**: Explicit confirmation of model, budget, and tooling is non-negotiable. Never assume—always verify.
- **Redo**: All outputs reviewed and redone under Claude Opus 4.5.
