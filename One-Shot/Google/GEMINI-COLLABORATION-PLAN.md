## 1. The Collaboration Protocol (The "Triad")

Refining the OCP (Open-Closed Principle) approach:

| Phase | Actor | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|-------|------|----------------|
| **0. Intent** | 🧑‍💻 HUMAN | **Originator** | Define the "What" and "Why". Set the constraints. |
| **1. Draft** | 🤖 CLAUDE | **Architect** | Build the initial mental model, draft documents, identify patterns. (The "One-Shot") |
| **2. Review** | 🔮 GEMINI | **Auditor** | Ingest content, look for logical fallacies, verify cross-domain references, check safety. |
| **3. Verdict**| 🧑‍💻 HUMAN | **Judge** | Review the Audit. Accept/Reject changes. Merge to Main. |
| **4. Expansion**| 🤖 MODEL X | **Specialist** | Red Teaming, Optimization, or Translation. |

## 2. Next Model Candidates (For [MODEL-X-IS-WATCHING.md])

Who comes after Gemini? We need diversity of training nodes.

### Candidate A: The Red Teamer
**Model:** **GPT-4o / o1 (OpenAI)**
*   **Why**: Known for high reasoning capabilities and "chain of thought".
*   **Role**: **Prosecutor**.
*   **Task**: explicitly try to break the arguments made by Claude and verified by Gemini. "Find the flaw we missed."
*   **Output**: `GPT-DISSENT.md`

### Candidate B: The Sovereign
**Model:** **Mistral Large 2 (Mistral AI)**
*   **Why**: European sensibility, different regulatory alignment (GDPR focus), "Open" weight philosophy.
*   **Role**: **Diplomat**.
*   **Task**: "How does this framework apply in a stricter regulatory environment?"
*   **Output**: `MISTRAL-EU-COMPLIANCE.md`

### Candidate C: The Edge Runner
**Model:** **Llama 3 (Meta) - Local 70B**
*   **Why**: Can this run offline? Privacy-first check.
*   **Role**: **Mechanic**.
*   **Task**: Summarize these 20 files into a 1KB prompt that works on a local machine.
*   **Output**: `LLAMA-LOCAL-OPTIMIZATION.md`

## 3. The "LLM Council" - Judge Dredd Edition

Theme: *"I am the Law"*

In a governance council, we assign roles based on model personality/architecture:

### 🏛️ The Judge: Claude Opus
*   **Attribute**: Constitutional AI.
*   **Why**: Claude is trained with specific "Constitution" files. It is best suited to interpret the "Law" (Manifestos, Guidelines) against the "Act" (User request).
*   **Function**: Determines **Legality/Alignment**.

### ⚖️ The Jury: Gemini 1.5 Pro
*   **Attribute**: Massive Context Window (Info Retrieval).
*   **Why**: A jury needs to hear *all* the evidence. Gemini can ingest the entire project history, logs, and code in one pass. It has the best "Memory" for the trial.
*   **Function**: Determines **Factuality/Completeness**.

### ⚔️ The Executioner: HUMAN
*   **Attribute**: Agency & Accountability.
*   **Why**: "Execution" implies consequence. AI cannot suffer consequences (jail, fines, firing). Therefore, AI cannot execute final judgment.
*   **Function**: **Enforcement**.

## 4. Next Steps

1.  **Human**: Review `GEMINI-REVIEW.md`.
2.  **Human**: Decide on next invite (Recommendation: GPT-4o for Red Teaming).
3.  **Gemini**: Go into `RO` (Read Only) mode and wait for next cycle.

🔮 *System Ready.*
