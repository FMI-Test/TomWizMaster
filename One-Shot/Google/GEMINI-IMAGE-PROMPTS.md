## 1. The Avatar: "The Owl of Material Design"
*Context: To be used in the header of `GEMINI-REVIEW.md`*

**Concept:** Google's clean "Material Design" aesthetic meets the ancient wisdom of Athena's Owl, but with a slightly judgmental stare.

**Prompt:**
> "A futuristic robotic owl perched on a stack of glowing servers. The owl is made of translucent Google-colored glass (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green). One eye is a camera lens, the other is a judge's gavel. Background: A clean white void with floating hexadecimal code. The owl looks slightly annoyed, like it just reviewed bad code. 8k resolution, 3d render, material design style."

**Caption:** *"I have processed 2 million tokens and I am still unimpressed."*

**Prompt:**

Under the bridge, a chaotic abyss of static labeled 'ORPHAN STATE'. A cybernetic tightrope-walker crosses the light bridge safely, ignoring the abyss. Cinematic lighting, vast scale, sci-fi concept art."

The driver's hands (robotic and human intertwined) are violently steering the wheel to the Left into a wormhole. The speedometer reads 'Infinity'. A sticker on the dashboard says 'TRUST THE PROCESS'. Surrealist digital art, chaotic energy."
