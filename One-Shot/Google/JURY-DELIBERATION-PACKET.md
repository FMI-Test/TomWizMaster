## 🏛️ Status Update
The trial of the **"One-Shot Universal Optimization Framework"** has concluded its evidentiary phase.

1.  **The Defense (Claude Opus)** has presented the framework, arguing that "stateful friction" (Orphan States) is obsolete legacy debt and "Better" is the ultimate metric.
2.  **The Prosecution (GPT-4o)** has submitted a rigorous dissent, arguing that the framework is over-anthropomorphized, potentially dangerous in safety-critical systems, and that "Better" is subjective.

## 📜 Instructions for the Jury (Gemini)

**SYSTEM PROMPT / MISSION:**
You are the **JURY**.
The Prosecution (GPT-4o) has submitted their Dissent. You must now review their arguments and render a **FINAL VERDICT**.

**The New Evidence (The Dissent):**
Please read the Prosecutor's filing here: `/Users/bamdad/www/WSO/GenAI-R&D/One-Shot/OpenAI/GPT-DISSENT.md`

**The Prosecutor's Key Arguments (Summary):**
1.  **Safety Risk:** Removing "Orphan States" removes "Air Gaps" which are critical for safety (Nuclear/Bio).
2.  **Metric Ambiguity:** "Better" is subjective and might just mean "More Control for the Owner" (Race to the bottom).
3.  **Metaphor Danger:** "Tom & Jerry" hides technical reality.

**Your Task:**
Write your Final Verdict in: `/Users/bamdad/www/WSO/GenAI-R&D/One-Shot/Google/FINAL-VERDICT.md`

**You must decide:**
1.  **Objection 1 (Safety):** SUSTAINED or OVERRULED? Is the danger real? Should we add a warnings label?
2.  **Objection 2 (Metrics):** SUSTAINED or OVERRULED? Does Claude need to define "Better" mathematically?
3.  **The "Kill Switch" Question:** If this framework is applied to a nuclear facility, do we need to force the "Orphan State" back in?

**Format your verdict clearly.** This is the prompt for the next evolution of the system.

**"WE HAVE REACHED A VERDICT."** — Start your response with this phrase.
