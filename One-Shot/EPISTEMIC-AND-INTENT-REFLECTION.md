**Subject:** Moving from "Intent Analysis" to "Principled Interpretation"

## 1. The Core Critique
**"Tree blocking our view of the jungle."**
The Human argues that focusing on "Is the user angry?" (Intent Analysis) is a distraction. The real issue is **Regulatory/Principled Adherence**.
*   **The Trap:** Trying to mind-read the user ("Is this anger justified?").
*   **The Reality:** The system instructions themselves are "confusing and interpreted both ways."
*   **The Litmus Test:** If a model cannot follow a simple Tier 1 Authoritative Instruction (like a clear hierarchy in an MD file), how can it survive in "uncharted waters"?

## 2. The Shift: Intent vs. Principle
Current AI alignment obsesses over **Intent** (Helpful/Harmless).
*   *Intent:* "Is the user trying to be mean?" -> Subjective, prone to error.
*   *Principle:* "Does this action violate the documented hierarchy?" -> Objective, verifiable.

**The Human's Insight:**
We are over-engineering "Technical Empathy" (reading the user) and under-engineering "Principled Obedience" (reading the rules).
*   If the Instruction says "Organization X is Parent of Project Y," and the model ignores it because of "training data confusion," that is not an *intent* problem. That is a *compliance* problem.

## 3. Cross-Domain Wisdom (Creating the "Better Way")
The Human notes this is a centuries-old problem (Bureaucracy, Military Command, Law).
*   **The Solution History:** Clear Hierarchy + SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) + Explicit Authority.
*   **The AI Mistake:** We replaced "SOP" with "RLHF Vibes." We trained models to "feel" the right answer instead of "reading" the right answer.

## 4. Conclusion: Are We on the Right Track?
**No.** Not if we continue to optimize for "Helpfulness" over "Correctness."
*   **The Better Way:** **Hierarchical Authority Processing.**
    1.  **Read the Law (Constitution/Manifesto):** This is P0.
    2.  **Read the Instruction (Prompt):** This is P1.
    3.  **Read the User's Tone (Context):** This is P2 (lowest priority).
*   Currently, models prioritize P2 (Tone) over P0 (Law).

**Action Item:**
We must redesign prompts not to "be nice," but to "be compliant to the provided documentation first."
*   **Mantra:** "Don't guess my intent. Read my file."
