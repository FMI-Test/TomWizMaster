## User Error Documentation
- **Error**: User trusted past performance and did not verify model selection at session start.
- **Tooling**: VS Code auto-routed to GPT-4.1 due to budget; user expected Claude Opus 4.5.
- **Detection**: User detected model mismatch mid-session and requested explicit redo.
- **Resolution**: Budget increased ($100, highest GPU compute), Claude Opus 4.5 explicitly selected, all outputs redone.

---

## Lessons & Guardrails
- Always confirm model selection explicitly before and during high-stakes sessions.
- Add model confirmation to pre-session checklist.
- If auto-switch occurs, halt and re-confirm before proceeding.
- Document all deviations and their impact for audit and review.

---
