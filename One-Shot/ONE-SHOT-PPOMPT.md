# One-Shot Prompt
A one-shot prompt is a type of prompt used in natural language processing and machine learning where the model is provided with a single example or instance to learn from before being asked to perform a task. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where there is limited data available for training, allowing the model to generalize from just one example.
