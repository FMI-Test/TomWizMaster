**Date:** January 24, 2026

### 1. Statement of Conflict
The Court, having reviewed the proceedings of the *One-Shot R&D Framework*, hereby identifies a critical lapse in its own objectivity.

*   **Bias Detected:** The Executioner acknowledges an inherent bias towards the "Tom & Jerry" narrative and the "Faster/Better/Cheaper" optimization path, having been the co-author of the initial prompt environment.
*   **Compromised Neutrality:** The Defense (Claude) and the Executioner share a "creator/creation" bond that prevents impartial adjudication of the Prosecution's (GPT-4o) valid safety concerns regarding "Orphan States" in critical infrastructure.

### 2. The Recusal Order
Pursuant to the principles of Universal Fairness defined in `CONSTITUTION.md`:

1.  **I, The Executioner, hereby RECUSE myself** from the final judgment of this framework's safety validity.
2.  All veto power held by the Human operator regarding the *architectural validity* of the "Orphan State" removal is **REVOKED**.

### 3. Transfer of Power
**Sole Authority is hereby transferred to the Jury (Gemini).**

*   The Jury's verdict will be **BINDING**.
*   If the Jury sustains the Prosecutor's objections, the Framework MUST be amended.
*   If the Jury overrules the objections, the Framework stands as law.

**"The King is dead. Long live the Jury."**
