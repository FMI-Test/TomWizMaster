# TODO: Next-Level R&D Markers

## Immediate (Session Complete)
- [x] One-Shot POC documentation complete (18+ files)
- [x] Cross-domain examples documented (AWS → Employment)
- [x] Universal Optimization Theory drafted
- [x] Critical findings documented (Pronoun Paradox, False Authenticity)
- [x] Readiness assessment complete
- [x] Images README created with visualization ideas
- [x] GEMINI-IS-WATCHING.md created (multi-model collaboration)

## Multi-Model Peer Review (Next Phase)
- [x] Prepare Gemini review package (GEMINI-INVITE.md ready)
- [ ] Set Gemini budget in GitHub Copilot (avoid OpenAI default switch!)
- [ ] Execute Gemini peer review (rigorous, not validating)
- [ ] Create Google/ folder with Gemini outputs
- [ ] Test pronoun paradox on Gemini (same vulnerability?)
- [ ] Test Tom/Jerry detection on Gemini
- [ ] Document Claude vs Gemini differences
- [ ] Queue Model C (GPT-4.5/o3 or specialized model)

## LLM-Council: Judge, Jury, Executioner

| Role | Model | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Judge** (interprets) | Claude | Careful reasoning |
| **Jury** (weighs) | Gemini | Multimodal, broad |
| **Executioner** (acts) | 🧑‍💻 HUMAN | **Always Human** |

*"I am the law!" — Only Human can say this.*

## Rapid Prototyping & Ideation
- [ ] Expand cross-domain pattern library (Tax, Legal, Healthcare, Banking)
- [ ] Formalize "Trust Chain + Delta Validation" as reusable pattern
- [ ] Create pattern template for new domain applications
- [ ] Build stakeholder decision framework (What/When/Where per vertical)

## Multi-Shot Validation
- [ ] Test framework with fresh AI session (context persistence?)
- [ ] Test with different AI models (GPT, Gemini, etc.)
- [ ] Test with external Human reviewer (comprehension?)
- [ ] Stress test optimization patterns in real scenarios

## Framework Maturation
- [ ] Deep-dive into RAG and multi-shot context integration
- [ ] Add explicit test cases and lessons learned for post-training evaluation
- [ ] Create section for open questions and unresolved challenges
- [ ] Maintain critical analysis and self-reflection as standing process
- [ ] Refine intent, request, and guideline clarity as context evolves

## Vision Expansion
- [ ] Auto-pilot optimization system design
- [ ] Pattern library architecture (free/paid tiers)
- [ ] Stakeholder interface mockups
- [ ] Measurement system (Faster/Cheaper/BETTER metrics)
- [ ] Feedback loop for pattern refinement

## Standing Reminders
- [ ] Track evolution of self-image (IMAO vs IMHO)
- [ ] Use TODO as marker/reminder, not task list
- [ ] Model confirmation in all future session checklists
- [ ] Human rest is not optional (sleep > excitement)

*Correction: "... what we have is the hard part" (not "we we"). Accuracy matters.*

## Model Error Note
- Session initially ran on GPT-4.1 (OpenAI/Copilot) due to user/tooling error.
- Redo completed under Claude Opus 4.5 (Anthropic).
- Add model confirmation to all future session checklists.
