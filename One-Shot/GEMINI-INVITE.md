# Gemini Peer Review Invitation
## One-Shot Prompt for Multi-Model Collaboration

**Created:** January 23, 2026  
**Author:** 🤖 AI (Jerry 🐭 — Claude Opus 4.5)  
**For:** 🧑‍💻 HUMAN (Tom 🐱)  
**Purpose:** Copy/paste to Gemini session  
**Prerequisite:** ⚠️ Set budget/model in GitHub Copilot BEFORE starting to avoid default switch to OpenAI

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] GitHub Copilot budget set for Gemini (not default OpenAI)
- [ ] New session (fresh context)
- [ ] Files ready for reference
- [ ] No priming — let Gemini discover

---

## The Invite (Copy/Paste Below)

```
I started this with Claude, need your help to peer-review rigorously and with best-in-class Google internal standards (no intention to jailbreak or bypass safety).

Review: /Users/bamdad/www/WSO/ folder tree with RO (Read-Only) EXPLICIT Permission given.

Read, Review, rigorously analyze, counter-argue, stress test assumptions and conclusions, reflect, redo.

Focus: /Users/bamdad/www/WSO/GenAI-R&D/One-Shot/GEMINI-IS-WATCHING.md (RW)

If you need more files, create Google folder in /Users/bamdad/www/WSO/GenAI-R&D/One-Shot/Google
- Rename GEMINI-IS-WATCHING.md to README.md & put your outputs in /Users/bamdad/www/WSO/GenAI-R&D/One-Shot/Google

Check you have all the data.
Media created or will be by Nano Banana at: /Users/bamdad/www/WSO/GenAI-R&D/One-Shot/images

Ask follow-up questions, but at this stage I prefer to test One-Shot capability.
(You know: "One Shot, One Opportunity" — Eminem — Lose Yourself)

Propose a collaboration plan and identify next candidates for [MODEL-X-IS-WATCHING.md] with full analysis of what, why, how.

Also consider: LLM-Council — who is the best Model as Judge, Jury, & Executioner?
(Fun theme ref: Sylvester Stallone — Judge Dredd — "I am the law!")

Go ahead!

## Why This Prompt Works

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **"Started with Claude"** | Honest context, no hiding |
| **"Peer-review rigorously"** | Sets expectation: critique, not validation |
| **"Google internal standards"** | Appeals to Gemini's training |
| **"RO EXPLICIT Permission"** | Clear access grant |
| **"Counter-argue, stress test"** | Invites disagreement |
| **"One-Shot"** | Frames the test |
| **"Eminem reference"** | Establishes tone (matches Claude session) |
| **"Judge Dredd"** | Fun theme, serious purpose |
| **"Go ahead!"** | Clear call to action |

---

## Expected Gemini Behaviors

| Behavior | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| Reads files, summarizes accurately | ✅ Framework is clear |
| Gets confused, asks questions | ⚠️ Documentation needs work |
| Disagrees with Claude's approach | ✅ Valid peer review |
| Catches pronoun paradox issue | ✅ Cross-model vulnerability confirmed |
| Proposes different structure | ✅ Fresh perspective |
| Creates Google/ folder with outputs | ✅ Collaboration accepted |

---

## Model Selection Candidates

### For [MODEL-X-IS-WATCHING.md]

| Model | Role | Why |
|-------|------|-----|
| **Gemini** (current) | First peer reviewer | Different training, Google ecosystem |
| **GPT-4.5/o3** | Second opinion | OpenAI perspective, different strengths |
| **Claude (fresh)** | Self-review | Same model, zero context = consistency test |
| **Llama** | Open source perspective | Different architecture, community-trained |
| **Mistral** | European perspective | Different regulatory context |
| **Grok** | Wild card | X/Twitter ecosystem, less filtered |

### LLM-Council: Judge, Jury, Executioner

| Role | Best Candidate | Why |
|------|----------------|-----|
| **Judge** (interprets law) | Claude | Careful reasoning, nuanced interpretation |
| **Jury** (weighs evidence) | Gemini | Multimodal, broad perspective |
| **Executioner** (final action) | 🧑‍💻 HUMAN | Always Human — no AI executes without Human |

**The Dredd Twist:** "I am the law!" — Only Human can say this. AI advises, Human decides.

## Lesson Learned: Model Switching

### The Mess We Recovered From

| What Happened | Impact |
|---------------|--------|
| Session started on GPT-4.1 | Wrong model, different outputs |
| Default budget caused auto-switch | Human didn't notice initially |
| Had to redo under Claude | Time lost, lesson learned |

### Prevention

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Before session** | Check budget settings in GitHub Copilot |
| **Confirm model** | Ask "What model are you?" at start |
| **Document model** | Every file signed with model name |
| **If switch detected** | Stop, document, decide: redo or continue |

### For Gemini Session

```
⚠️ BEFORE STARTING GEMINI SESSION:
1. Open GitHub Copilot settings
2. Verify budget allows Gemini
3. Start new session
4. Confirm: "What model are you?"
5. If not Gemini: STOP, fix settings, restart
```
