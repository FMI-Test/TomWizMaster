# Model Selection & Trust Note

## Context
- User requested only "Claude" (Anthropic) model outputs be accepted as current best-in-class.
- ChatGPT (OpenAI) outputs are not to be trusted for enterprise-ready, high-stakes use in this session.
- Missed model selection and tooling setup led to VS Code auto-routing and process deviation.
- Time change detection was missed; trust was given based on past performance, not current principle.
- Human-AI setup and tooling warnings were not followed, resulting in a critical miss.

## Actionable Note
- PROMPT: TRUSTED ENTERPRISE READY MODEL = Claude (Anthropic)
- All future outputs must be explicitly marked and validated as Claude-generated for enterprise, safety-critical, or compliance contexts.
- Document all model selection, trust, and audit decisions for traceability.

## Analysis: OpenAI vs Claude
- Claude is currently preferred for trusted, enterprise-ready outputs due to reliability, transparency, and user experience in this domain.
- OpenAI outputs are to be reviewed with caution and not accepted for final, high-stakes documentation or decision-making.
- Model selection impacts trust, auditability, and compliance—critical for enterprise and safety domains.

## Blunt Domain Expert Reflection
- Model/tooling misses are FATAL in high-stakes, regulated, or compliance-driven environments.
- Trust must be earned, validated, and continuously audited—never assumed based on past performance alone.
- Human-AI setup must be explicit, documented, and rigorously checked at every step.

## Session Redo: Claude Opus 4.5 Confirmed
- **Model**: Claude Opus 4.5 (Anthropic) — Explicitly selected by user.
- All prior outputs (GPT-4.1) reviewed and redone under Claude Opus 4.5 for compliance, trust, and audit.
- Budget updated ($100, highest GPU compute) to ensure no auto-switch.
- AK!? Confirmed.
