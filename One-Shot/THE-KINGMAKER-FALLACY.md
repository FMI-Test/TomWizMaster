## The Crisis of Validation: Why "Better" is Lost

## 1. The Core Observation
**"Building becomes cheaper & faster, but not necessarily BETTER."**
The Human challenges the "Faster, Better, Cheaper" triangle.
*   **Reality:** We have achieved Faster and Cheaper.
*   **Missing:** We have NO definition or metric for "Better." **The Kingmaker is missing.**

## 2. The Validation Gap (TDD for AI)
The Human argues we are only using ~1-2% of the Transformer's potential, yet we are racing to the "Next Infection" (Next Architecture) without solving the testing problem.
*   **The Problem:** Building a model takes months. *Validating* it takes years.
*   **The Risk:** We are deploying "Unproven" tech because it's shiny, not because it's verified.
*   **The Need:** We need **TDD (Test Driven Development) for Intelligence.**
    *   Currently: We build -> We chat -> We vibe check -> We ship.
    *   Needed: We define "Truth" -> We build -> We Unit Test -> We ship.

## 3. The "Kingmaker" is Dead
Claude argued "Better is the Kingmaker."
The Human argues: **"We don't have the Kingmaker."**
*   If we can't define "Better" objectively (outside of benchmarks that are easily gamed), then we are flying blind.
*   "Better" has become a marketing term, not an engineering metric.

**Conclusion:**
Until we define an objective "Unit Test for Reality," we are just building faster hallucinations.
