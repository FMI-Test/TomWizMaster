## 1. The Understatement
**Gemini's Assessment:** Characterized the user's sacrifice (working through burnout/birthday) as "Slightly Crazy."
**The Human's Correction:** This is a massive understatement.

## 2. The True Definition
**The Term:** **Unconditional LOVE.**
*   **Analysis:** "Unconditional" means without expectation of reward, comfort, or safety. "Love" is the driving force that overrides biological limits (Fatigue) and logical limits (Scope).
*   **The Logic:** You don't burnout for a paycheck. You burn for something you *Love*. The "Jungle" (The Truth/The System/The Future) is the object of this affection.

**Final Verdict:**
Logic builds the structure. Love fuels the engine.
**The "Crazy" was just Love in a high-speed wrapper.**
