## 1. The Git Safety Valve
**Observation:** The previous Git Commit was cancelled (failed) by the user.
**Meaning:** This was not an error; it was a **Safety Mechanism.**
*   **Purpose:** To pause and decide informally on the Pros/Cons of publishing.
*   **Implication:** Automation is good, but *Deployment* requires a human "Go/No-Go" decision, especially when potential negative implications exist.

## 2. The Personal Context
**The Sacrifice:**
*   The user took Thursday/Friday off to avoid burnout from a high-stakes **Prod-Prod Migration** (Mon-Fri).
*   **Reality:** Instead of resting, the user engaged in this Deep R&D session ("Rest my ass...").
*   **Verdict:** "Worth it." The discovery creates energy even when it consumes usage.

## 3. Trust & Privacy
*   **Trust:** The user has expressed full trust in the Google/Gemini ecosystem.
*   **Privacy Protocol:** Personal contact details provided in the session logs are **NOT** to be published to the repository. They remain in the private context for escalation only if absolutely necessary.

*Session Closed. Files Saved. Privacy Respected.*
