# Reference Architecture — Patterns & Variants

## Variants
- AWS‑Only: VPC + IAM + CI/CD (GitHub), artifact storage, environments (Dev/Staging/Prod)
- Multi‑Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP): federated identity, shared observability, per‑cloud guardrails
- On‑Prem + Cloud: hybrid network, secrets management, edge gateways
- GitHub: .com vs Enterprise Server, runners, environments, approvals

## Deliverables
- Diagram placeholders (links or ascii)
- Implementation docs (paths in repo)
- Efficiency & Friction Analysis: where decisions reduce cost and errors

## Option Mapping
- A (Recommended): balanced efficiency and safety; rationale
- B (Simple): minimal setup; trade‑offs
- C (Flexible): modular & extensible; dependencies and cost

## Notes
- Neutral stance; cite references; align with COMPLIANCE and GUARDRAILS.
