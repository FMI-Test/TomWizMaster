## 🎯 What This Is

This repository contains a **meta-framework** for AI-assisted development, treating human-AI collaboration like systems architecture:

- **Manifesto** → Why we build
- **Constitution** → Core principles that don't change
- **Guardrails** → Boundaries and red lines
- **Shared Responsibility** → Who owns what
- **Projects** → Vertical-specific applications

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

### The AWS Parallel

This framework mirrors proven governance patterns:

| **AWS Concept** | **This Framework** | **Purpose** |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Organizations | GenAI-R&D repo | Central governance |
| SCPs | GUARDRAILS.md | Boundary policies |
| Shared Responsibility Model | SHARED-RESPONSIBILITY.md | Accountability |
| Regions/AZs | Project folders | Isolation & context |
| CloudTrail | DESIGN.md | Audit trail |

### The Constitutional Parallel

| **Government** | **This Framework** | **Purpose** |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Declaration of Independence | MANIFESTO.md | Why we exist |
| Constitution | CONSTITUTION.md | Immutable principles |
| Bill of Rights | GUARDRAILS.md | Protected boundaries |
| Separation of Powers | SHARED-RESPONSIBILITY.md | Checks & balances |

## 🎯 "Faster, Better, Cheaper"

The guiding principle across all projects:

| **Dimension** | **Meaning** | **Guardrail** |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Faster** | Reduce idea → validated learning time | Don't sacrifice understanding |
| **Better** | Higher quality per unit effort | Don't gold-plate |
| **Cheaper** | Lower cost (time, money, cognitive) | Don't sacrifice core value |

**Balance Check:** If optimizing one significantly hurts another → STOP and reconsider.
